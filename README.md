Although there are many, many, many Workout Timer apps on Google Play and on the App Store, most of them are specific to a mobile platform, and can't be run except on android/iOS devices. The best one (IMHO) is "Impetus" which runs on android devices.
It does ALMOST everything I want, but there are a few funnies which I can't work around (yet), so I decided to try and create my own, web based version, which will run on anything with a browser, and which DOES do what I want.

Initially I will start in HTML for the layout, and then will slowly add extra functions using vue.js and/or nuxt.js (which I still have to learn)
